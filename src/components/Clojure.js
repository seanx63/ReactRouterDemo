        "Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data
        philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a
        functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable,
        persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers
        a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that
        ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs."
      </p>

      <p>
        Clojure as a LISP dialect differs greatly in syntax than programming
        languages that focus on Object-oriented principles as LISP dialects are
        known for focusing on functional programming.
